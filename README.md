# Polish-verb-conjugator

This GitHub repository contains a Terminal/CLI-based automated verb conjugator for the Polish language. The conjugator takes a language typological approach to the problem by grouping verbs into morphologically similar categories instead of relying on statistical models or large language models (LLMs). The tool covers present-tense singular and plural forms, including irregular verb categories. Planned functionalities include exceptions (in progress), past/future tense, and a front-end interface.

Personal pronouns are included in the brackets.

The code was last updated and reviewed on 10.9.2023.
